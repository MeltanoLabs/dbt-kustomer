# Kustomer Meltano tap data transformation for dbt

This package is designed to work alongside the [Kustomer Meltano tap](https://github.com/brooklyn-data/tap-kustomer) to transform the data into an easy-to-use format.

Supported warehouses:

- Snowflake
- Bigquery
- PostgreSQL
- Redshift

## Installation and use

1. Include the following package version in your `packages.yml` file. Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest version to use.

```yml
packages:
    - package: meltano/kustomer # TBC
      version: 0.1.0 # TBC
```

2. Install the package by running `dbt deps`

3. In your `dbt_project.yml` file, include the location where the tap data is expected to load from:

```yml
vars:
  kustomer_schema: your_database_schema # By default this is `tap_kustomer`
```

4. Choose which schemas you want to build the tables in by including this in your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
models:
  dbt_kustomer:
    marts:
      +schema: your_marts_schema # By default this is `kustomer`
    staging:
      +schema: your_staging_schema # By default this is `stg_kustomer`
```

5. Build the tables by running

```sh
dbt run --select package:dbt_kustomer
```

## Tables

These are the tables that will be built with this project.

TODO - Add ERD of tables once all created
